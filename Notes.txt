npm init (-y) --> to create package.json  (-y  -->   for no questions)

npm i express --> for node modules and package-lock.json

npm install -D tailwindcss --> for tailwind

npx tailwindcss init --> "initialize" Tailwind and create a "tailwind.config.js" file
--> inside it we need to put all the files we need to track 
--> in our case it is all the html files    (`./views/**/*.html`)
